# FrontEnd-Assessment

Medical Dashboard Application
Overview
This project is a Medical Dashboard Application built with React and Material UI, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing medical records, examinations, and consultations. The application displays user information, medical examination history, health metrics (e.g., heartbeat, blood count, glucose levels), officer details, and a consultations section. It adheres to modern web development standards, focusing on responsive design, pixel-perfect implementation, and robust state management.
The application matches the design specifications provided in the UI mockup, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices while incorporating error handling and Material UI components for a polished look and feel.
Features

User Information: Displays user details such as name, employee ID, age, weight, height, and blood type.
Medical Examination: Lists past medical examination records with clickable entries.
Health Metrics: Visualizes health data (heartbeat, blood pressure, glucose levels, blood count) using charts.
Officer Details: Shows medical officer information, including designations and registration numbers.
Consultations: Provides a list of consultations with doctor details, dates, and treatment information.
Reports Section: Displays downloadable medical reports with view and download options.

Evaluation Criteria
Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes:

Mobile (xs): Components stack vertically, with the sidebar assumed to be a drawer (not implemented). BloodStatusCard and GlucoseLevelCard stack vertically, and the layout adjusts to fit smaller screens.
Tablet (sm): Components like BloodStatusCard and GlucoseLevelCard are displayed side by side, while maintaining readability and usability.
Desktop (md and above): The layout matches the provided design mockup, with a two-column layout (7:5 ratio) for the main content.
Responsive adjustments are implemented using Material UI’s breakpoint syntax (e.g., sx={{ width: { xs: '100%', sm: '102px' } }}).

Pixel Perfect Implementation
The application closely matches the provided UI mockup:

Dimensions and Spacing: Component dimensions (e.g., HeartbeatCard at 200px height and 400px width, ReportsSection at 300px height and 400px width) and spacing (e.g., reduced top padding in BloodCountCard) are adjusted to match the design.
Visual Elements: The heartbeat graph in HeartbeatCard uses SVG paths that replicate the mockup’s design. Charts in BloodCountCard and other components use consistent styling (e.g., stroke="#4a90e2", fill="#e6f0fa").
Typography and Icons: Typography sizes, weights, and colors (e.g., fontSize: '1.5rem' for values, color: '#09A2E3' for icons) align with the mockup.

State Management

The application currently uses local component state for static data (e.g., bloodCountData in BloodCountCard).
Interactive components like Consultations include event handlers for actions (e.g., handleFileClick, handlePillClick) that simulate user interactions (currently using alert for demonstration).
For a production environment, state management can be enhanced using a library like Redux or React Context to handle global state (e.g., user data, consultation records), but the current implementation is sufficient for the static mockup.

Material UI Usage

The application extensively uses Material UI components and its design system:
Components: Paper, Box, Typography, Stack, Grid, Button, IconButton, Divider, and icons like OpenInNewIcon, VisibilityIcon, and DownloadIcon.
Styling: Material UI’s sx prop is used for styling (e.g., sx={{ p: 2, borderRadius: 3 }} in HeartbeatCard).
Responsive Design: Breakpoint syntax is used for responsive layouts (e.g., sx={{ flexDirection: { xs: 'column', sm: 'row' } }} in App.js).
Charts: recharts library components (AreaChart, ResponsiveContainer) are used for visualizing health metrics, styled to match Material UI’s aesthetic.



Error Handling

Error Boundaries: The ErrorBoundary component is implemented in App.js to wrap each major section (Sidebar, Topbar, UserInfo, etc.), ensuring that errors in one component do not crash the entire application.
User Feedback: Interactive components like Consultations provide feedback via alert messages (e.g., alert('Open file for consultation #${index + 1}')). In a production environment, this can be replaced with Material UI Snackbar or Toast components for better user experience.
Data Handling: Static data is used to avoid runtime errors, but in a real-world scenario, API calls would include try-catch blocks and loading states.
